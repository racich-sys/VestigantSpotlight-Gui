# Vestigant Spotlight User Manual

## V1.1.9 update

- Current generated source package: V1.1.9.
- Validated baseline reviewed before this version: V1.1.8 Windows/MSVC build and macOS AFF4/APFS thin output.
- Main change: guarded live APFS OMAP horizontal leaf traversal with bounded next-leaf transitions.
- Source-package `.md`, `.txt`, and `.ps1` file review completed; see `docs/SOURCE_DOCS_SCRIPTS_REVIEW_V1_1_9.md`.

### V0_9_42 V1-readiness note

V0_9_42 tightens normal iOS compact-mode text storage to keep Missing From FFS text visibility without exceeding the DB guardrail on the current large iOS source. GUI review-page loads are now tracked and cancellable instead of detached.

## V1.1.8 Update

- `BaselineVersionHistory.md` is now the append-only version-history baseline in `docs/FULL_VERSION_HISTORY.md` and `VERSION_HISTORY.md`.
- Windows long-path evidence writes were added for APFS/AFF4 Store-V2 copy-out and decmpfs reconstruction output paths.
- SQLite WAL checkpoint/truncate is requested before upload packaging.
- Logger writes are mutex-protected for concurrent GUI/export/ingest paths.
- APFS decmpfs reconstruction remains bounded; the expected-output safety cap is now 256 MiB.
