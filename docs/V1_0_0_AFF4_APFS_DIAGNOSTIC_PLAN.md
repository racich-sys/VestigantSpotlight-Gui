# Vestigant Spotlight V1.0.0 Notes

V1.0.0 starts the post-0.9.x V1 line. It keeps the stable V0_9_60 GUI/iOS baseline and moves the next work back toward macOS Spotlight investigation from AFF4/APFS forensic images.

## What changed in V1.0.0

- Version identifiers were advanced to `1.0.0` in `VERSION`, `VERSION.txt`, `CMakeLists.txt`, and `src/core/app_info.cpp`.
- Added a V1 AFF4/APFS diagnostic rerun artifact set written during AFF4 source-probe runs:
  - `AFF4_APFS_V1_DIAGNOSTIC_RERUN_PLAN.md`
  - `aff4_apfs_v1_diagnostic_checklist.csv`
  - `aff4_apfs_v1_diagnostic_plan_summary.json`
- Added those V1 AFF4/APFS diagnostic files to the thin-upload review index and upload bundle copy list.
- Updated the single-AFF4 probe wrapper defaults for the V1.0.0 case/output names.
- Added concrete V1.0.0 PowerShell scripts:
  - `scripts/Build-V1_0_0.ps1`
  - `scripts/Launch-V1_0_0-GUI.ps1`
  - `scripts/Run-V1_0_0-macOS-AFF4-Probe-AndZip.ps1`
  - copy/paste command text files for GUI and AFF4/APFS testing.
- Kept AFF4/APFS and Raw IMG/DD source-type paths visible as staged/experimental workflows rather than hiding them.

## V1.0.0 decision rule

Do not make broad APFS reconstruction changes from the old V0_8_69 external-compare bundle alone. First run a fresh V1.0.0 strict single-AFF4 diagnostic against:

`O:\0109_0142-IT001\disk3 2024-10-01 10-43-40\0109_0142-IT001.aff4`

Then review the new thin upload to classify the next fix as one of:

- AFF4 container/virtual read access,
- APFS checkpoint or object-map resolution,
- APFS filesystem root-tree namespace traversal,
- Spotlight target inode/xattr/extent correlation,
- sparse/gap/zero-physical-block reconstruction policy,
- decmpfs/resource-fork handling,
- staged Store-V2 parsing/enrichment,
- external-reference comparison,
- macOS investigator views.

## Validation performed in this package

- Reviewed uploaded `V0_9_60_build.log`; it shows CLI, tests, and GUI linked successfully and the built binary reported `Vestigant Spotlight v0.9.60`.
- Reviewed the old `Upload_Thin_V0_8_69_ExternalCompare.zip` enough to confirm historical AFF4/APFS extraction reached staged Store-V2 parsing/enrichment and external comparison, but it is old and should not be treated as current V1 truth.
- Performed a Linux CMake build and ran the included self-test for V1.0.0 in this environment.
- Performed static checks for common MSVC C2026 raw-string risk.

Windows/MSVC GUI build and the live AFF4 image probe still require execution on the user's Windows machine with access to the standard O:, Q:, T:, and D: paths.
